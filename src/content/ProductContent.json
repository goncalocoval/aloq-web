  "text": "Aloq uses the AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) method to help businesses compare incubators and tech parks based on seven key criteria - cost, location, parking, meeting rooms, office amenities (furniture, Wi-Fi, printing/copying equipment), public transportation, and on-site dining facilities. The platform makes decision-making quick and intuitive."
